- 👋 Hi, I’m @JFelipe-bit
- 👀 I’m interested in developing AI tools for decentralized systems
- 🌱 I'm currently working on building applications using AI, with a focus on enhancing user experience and improving system efficiency.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on geosicences/geophysics/sesimic/magnetometry/GPR (because it is my background)
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm always open to collaborating with like-minded individuals who share my interests and passion. If you're working on something related to geosciences or decentralized systems, I'd be glad to see how we can work together. Feel free to reach out to me via email at jfelipe.barradas@gmail.com.
